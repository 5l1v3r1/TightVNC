-  useful in administration, tech support, education, and for many other purposes,
-  cross-platform, available for Windows and Unix, with Java client included,
-  compatible with standard VNC software, conforming to RFB protocol specifications.

With TightVNC, you can:
-  **cut your expenses** and **save your time** on traveling,
-  help your friends and family to solve problems with their computers remotely,
-  make sure nothing wrong is happening on your computers when you are away.


原版的TightVNC编译非常不方便，我直接使用idea+maven重新编译了一遍

这个版本是基于tightvnc 2.7.2版本，直接编译的话是带ssh的
